1. Open application as any other OutSystems application and it will allow you to jump to where the application documentation is;
2. Or go to directly to the following URL: _https://&lt;Your Environment URL>/MonitorProbe_

Change the part **&lt;Your Environment URL>** for the url of the environment where you have installed _MonitorProbe_ and the Platform will redirect you to the MonitorProbe main page which the URL will be:
_https://&lt;Your Environment URL>/MonitorProbe/rest/PlatformLogs/_


**On this Monitor Probe main page** you will be able to see:
* The several endpoints from which it is possible to extract monitoring data;
  Each endpoint corresponds to a OutSystems Monitoring data type (Error logs, General logs, etc)  
* And if you expand it you will be able to see  REST API endpoints examples on how to do it.


# How to use Monitor Probe (OutSystems configurations you need to assure)
1. Go to LifeTime and create a service account to access LifetimeAPI methods (applicable if the lifetime version is 11.5 or higher)

![ServiceAccountConfig](https://github.com/OutSystems/MonitorProbe/blob/main/Documentation/images/CreateServiceAccount.png)
2. The service account needs to have a role with permissions to Manage Infrastructure and Users in order to be able to access some of LifetimeAPI methods

![ServiceAccountRolePermissions](https://github.com/OutSystems/MonitorProbe/blob/main/Documentation/images/ServiceAccountRolePermissions.png)

3. Save the token of the service account created previously
4. Create an IT user with a default role that has the minimum permission level to access the logs

![Create_IT_User](https://github.com/OutSystems/MonitorProbe/blob/main/Documentation/images/CreateITUser.png)

5. Install/Update the MonitorProbe
6. Now go to the detail of the module in service center and open the tab site properties

7. Set the effective value of the site property **Authentication_ServiceAccountToken** with the token that you saved on step 3
8. Set the effective value of the site property **MinimumPermissionLevelLabel** with the permission label that the default role has on the environment where you have installed the MonitorProbe

![RoleConfiguration](https://github.com/OutSystems/MonitorProbe/blob/main/Documentation/images/RoleConfiguration.png)
